Hi, Thanks for your interest in me.

I am Athul Raj K.

I completed my master's degree in **Mathematics** from
National Institute of Technology Surat, India. For my master's thesis I
worked with the Real-Time Systems Research Group at **Max Planck Institute
for Software Systems(MPI-SWS)** and was advised by
[Dr. Bj√∂rn B. Brandenburg](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~bbb/). During my
masters thesis I worked on using formal methods for response-time analysis
using **Rocq**(Coq) proof assistant. If you think that is interesting, check
out the work [here](https://prosa.mpi-sws.org/).

I like mathematics and computer science and try to learn and explore more
of it. Usually it so happens that I might be reading something or watching
some videos on youtube, and something interesting catches my eye and try to
read more about it, if it seems really interesting to me, I get a book
on the topic and learn more about it.

I am a self taught programmer and I love working on personal projects,
and tend to do so a lot (though a lot of them remain incomplete). Check out
some personal projects of mine [here](https://github.com/krathul).
I like learning new things, and programming languages happens to be such a
thing. I occasionally stumble on a new programming language, try to tinker with
it, and then leave it. Though some of the programming languages I have tried
have remained with me, and I tend to use them for my projects like C, C++, Rust,
Go and Python.

I also work on open source projects primarily in the KDE community
(though not so active at the moment) where I have worked on [KDE
Frameworks(KF6)](https://develop.kde.org/products/frameworks/) and
[Okular(Document Viewer)](https://okular.kde.org/en-gb/).

Apart from that, I love playing football, watching movies (a lot), playing video games,
reading books, and travelling.
